          As a Fullstack Developer & Business Analyst Intern, I was responsible
          for a diverse range of tasks that required both technical proficiency
          and business acumen. One of my primary responsibilities was leading
          the full revamp of the company’s website. This involved managing the

          enhanced user experience.

        <p className="mb-4 text-left text-lg text-text">
          I collaborated closely with the CEO, CFO, CTO, and other key
          stakeholders to gather business requirements and feedback from end
          users. This required not only technical skills but also effective
          communication and project management abilities. I led teams to ensure

          One of the most interesting aspects of my role was developing a custom
          payroll system that automated manual processes. This significantly
          improved accuracy and reduced overhead for the company, increasing
          payroll processing efficiency by 87.5%. Additionally, I developed the
          Routeview system for newspaper distributors, a unique tool that
          optimized delivery routes and allowed for customer-specific requests,
          greatly enhancing operational efficiency and user satisfaction.

        <p className="mb-4 text-left text-lg text-text">
          My internship at BoscoBoys was not just an opportunity to apply what I
          had learned—it was an environment that challenged me to grow,
          innovate, and contribute in meaningful ways. Through projects like
          revamping the website and automating key business processes, I made
          tangible improvements that enhanced the company's operational
          efficiency. These accomplishments helped me develop a deeper
          understanding of how technology can drive business success.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-left text-lg text-text">
          One of the most valuable aspects of this experience was the blend of
          technical development and business analysis. I strengthened my ability
          to balance coding with strategic thinking, ensuring that every
          technical solution aligned with business goals. Whether optimizing
          databases, improving payroll systems, or enhancing customer-facing
          interfaces, I consistently aimed to deliver solutions that would have
          lasting value for the company.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-left text-lg text-text">
          The skills I honed in fullstack development, database management, and
          process automation have not only boosted my confidence as a developer
          but have also prepared me for future roles that require a strong
          balance of technical and business acumen. This experience has shaped
          my professional identity, reinforcing my passion for creating
          impactful, user-centered technology solutions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-left text-lg text-text">
          As I move forward, I am excited to build on these learnings, applying
          both the technical expertise and collaborative skills I developed at
          BoscoBoys to future challenges. This internship has laid a solid
          foundation for my career, and I look forward to contributing to future
          projects with the same level of enthusiasm and dedication.
